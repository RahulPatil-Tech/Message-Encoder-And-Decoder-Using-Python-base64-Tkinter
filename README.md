# Message-Encoder-And-Decoder-Using-Python-base64-Tkinter
Message encoding and decoding is the process to first convert the original text to the random and meaningless text called ciphertext. This process is called encoding. Decoding is the process to convert that ciphertext to the original text. This process is also called the Encryption-Decryption process.

# <br>Message Encode-Decode Python Project</br>
This objective of this project is to encode and decode messages using a common key. This project will be built using the Tkinter and base64 library.
In this project, users have to enter the message to encode or decode. Users have to select the mode to choose the encoding and decoding process. The same key must be used to process the encoding and decoding for the same message.

# <br>Project Prerequisites</br>
To build this project we will use basic concept of python, Tkinter, and base64 library.
1. <b>Tkinter</b> is a standard GUI python library
2. <b>base64</b> module provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.

# <br>Project File Structure</br>
These are the step to build message encode â€“ decode python project
<br><b>Import module</b></br>
<br><b>Create display window</b></br>
<br><b>Define function</b></br>
<br><b>Define labels and buttons</b></br>
